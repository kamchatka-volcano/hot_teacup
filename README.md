# â˜•hot_teacup


**hot_teacup** - is a C++17 library for parsing HTTP requests data received over the FastCGI connection and forming HTTP responses.  
It supports reading of HTTP headers, cookies, query strings, URL encoded and multipart forms.   
The library is designed to be used with the FastCGI protocol, so input data is expected to be percent-decoded by the web server.
The headers are self-explanatory, so there's no documentation. You can also check the unit tests if you need examples of usage.
